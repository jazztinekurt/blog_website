    <h2>The Importance of a Simple Morning Routine</h2>

      Mornings often set the tone for the rest of the day. How I start my morning affects my mood, focus, and energy. Over time, I learned that having a simple routine helps me feel more prepared and calm.

      Instead of rushing, I try to wake up a little earlier to give myself time to breathe and think. Doing small things like stretching or drinking water helps my body adjust and makes the morning less stressful.

      Consistency is not always easy, especially on busy days. There are mornings when I skip parts of my routine, and that is okay. What matters is trying again the next day without being too hard on myself.

      Having a morning routine improved my focus and made me feel more organized. It also gave me a sense of control over my time, even when the rest of the day becomes unpredictable.

      A simple morning routine does not need to be perfect to be effective. Small habits done consistently can make a big difference. By starting my day with intention, I feel more ready to face whatever comes next.
